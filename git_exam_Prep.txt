Git is version control system, and central repository, where we can deploy our code.

How to see the current status of your working directory

git status 

How to cancel the changes of current file/before staging what content i have to retain.

How to create a branch 

git branch branch_name

git checkout -b branchName

How to move to branch 

git checkout branch_name 

How to Delete a branch 

git branch -d branch_name 

git brach -D branch_name 

How to change the starting position of the branch 

git rebase 

What is the differece between merge and rebase 

merge used to merge two branches files into a single branch 

then no need to give command as 

git pull origin branch_name 

but merge never does, 

   -> Changing the starting position of the branch

   => Changing order of the commits 

   => Combining multiple commings into single commit

   -> Edit the commit message 

But, in rebase you can do all these things. 

git stash : Cleans the working directory. 

git stash pop : Go back to the previous stage of git stash

git stash drop : You cannot recover the files from staging. 

git fetch command that tell your local git retrive latest changes from the original files, (dont do any file transferring, 
its just like to see any changes happend in files), 

git pull on the other hand brings all the hanges and files from the remote repository.

git pull = git fetch + git merge 

git fetch : Will not perfom any merge conflits or updates. For safer side if you want to download any files,
then please go for git fetch. As it will not spoil any of your old data. 

But, if you want to fetch the data and perfom any modifications in data w.r.t. Then 

please go for git pull

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

git fetch used  to get updates from single branch or multiple branches, but it will not update in your local repository, 
for safe side if you want to see the information, then you want to decide to merge branches or not then you have to go for 
git fetch, as it will not spoil your old data. 


git pull used to get updates from branch and updates in the current code which results the merge conflicts. 

git pull = git fetch + git merge
