Web Application : 
__________________

Web applications are the applications, that which are to be called from various
places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, 
then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways 

	1) scripting languages

	2) programming languages 

*** Scripting languages are langauges, that which are interpreted...So during runtime they takes 
lot of time to execute ***

*** Programming languages are langauges, that which are compiled first, so during runtime they takes very less time to execute ***

In Web Applications, we can implement 

	(i) Client-Side scripting

	(ii) Server-Side Scripting 

*** In Client-side scripting, enables you to access the application fro the client-system

  	No Network traffic

	Execution will be faster. 

*** In Server-Side scripting, enables you to access the application from the server.

	Network traffic will be high

	A bit slower. 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No Security, plesae opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. Security, please opt for both client-side/server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security, please opt for server-side scripting ***

Scripting Languages 

	1) HTML

	2) Javascript

	3) CSS/CSS3

	4) Jquery 


1) HTML

What is HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 

Which allows you to create any sample web pages. 

Why HTML 

Each html page will be defined w.r.t. Tags. 

Each tag will have begin and end tags. 

To start with html, we need

<html>
</html> 

<head>
</head> : Used to define the global content for the given page. 

<title>
</title> : Used to display heading on title bar. 

<body>
</body> : Used to define the actual content for the given page. 

<p>

</p> : Used to start a new paragraph. 

Definition Language : 
_______________________

If you want to represent text, that which contains definitions and

answers, we can use Definition Language. 

You can start with definition language, using 

<dl>
</dl> 

<dt>
</dt> : Definition term.

<dd>
</dd> : Definition Description. 

To add an image to the html page, we have to use <img> tag. 

<img src="image_file" />

Anchor tag. 

Used to redirect from one page to another page. 

You can redirect by using 

<a href="target_page">Display Text</a> 

<ol>

: Ordered List. 

<li> : List Item. 

<ul>

</ul> 

<style> : used to apply styles for the given tags. 

This tag to be defined inside the head tag. 

<div> Tag : Allows you to divide the page into multiple partitions. 

Forms : Allows you to accept data from the keyboard, you can place various types of control on the form
as

textbox
password
textarea
checkbox
radiobutton
dropdown
etc...

You can define forms, by using 

<form>
</form> 

Each form will have either id or name, with that we can access the form values. 

To place a textbox, we have to use 

<input type="text" name="txtName" /> 

Here, you can place buttons like

normal button, Submit button and reset button. 

<input type="button" value="Show" /> 

<input type="submit" value="Show" /> 

<input type="reset" value="Reset" /> 

Tables allows you to represent data w.r.t. Rows and Columns. 

If you want to make any design as accurate, then we need the help of tables. 

You can start with tables, by using 

<table>
</table> 

<tr>
</tr> : Used to add a new row to the table. 

<th> : Used to add a heading to the table cell. 
</th> 

<td>
</td> : Used to add data to the table cell content.
